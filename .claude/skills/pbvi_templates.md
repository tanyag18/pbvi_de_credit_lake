# PBVI Templates — v3.0

## Changelog

| Version | Date | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| v2.9 | April 2026 | Initial release — templates extracted from PBVI skill to standalone file. Contains: Session Log, Verification Record, ENH-NNN_SCOPE.md, Enhancement Brief, Sprint Manifest, Sprint Log, ENH-NNN_SPRINT_CONSTRAINTS.md. ENH-NNN_BCE_IMPACT.md maintained exclusively in BCE skill. |
| v3.0 | April 2026 | Invariant scope split — Template 2 Code Review references TASK-SCOPED invariants from task prompt and GLOBAL from Claude.md. Template 3 Section 4 adds GLOBAL/TASK-SCOPED classification table. Section 5 clarifies TASK-SCOPED additions do not trigger Claude.md version bump. Section 6 Tier 3 criteria updated to match. |

## How to Use This File

Load this file as a project file alongside the PBVI skill. When the skill instructs
"generate using the template from PBVI_TEMPLATES", use the corresponding template here.

**ENH-NNN_BCE_IMPACT.md is NOT in this file.** It is maintained exclusively in the
BCE skill. Load the BCE skill as a project file to access it.

**Template integrity rules apply to all templates here:**
- Fields marked LEAVE BLANK must never be pre-populated
- Fields marked pre-populate from EXECUTION_PLAN.md are populated at template creation
- Prediction statements are left blank in Manual mode; omitted entirely in Autonomous mode
- Human sign-off fields are never pre-filled

---

## Template 1 — Session Log (SESSION_LOG.md)

**When to generate:** At the start of every build session, before the first task begins.
**Pre-populate:** Task Id and Task Name from EXECUTION_PLAN.md. Leave Status and Commit blank.
**Leave blank:** All status fields, commit hashes, sign-off, decision log, deviations.

```markdown
# SESSION_LOG.md

## Session: [Session Name]
**Date started:** 
**Engineer:** 
**Branch:** session/s[n]_<short_desc>
**Claude.md version:** 
**Execution mode:** [ ] Manual (prediction discipline, human CC Challenge)
                  | [ ] Autonomous (sequential, no interruption, autonomous CC Challenge)
**Status:** In Progress

## Tasks

| Task Id | Task Name | Status | Commit |
|---------|-----------|--------|--------|
| [n.n]   | [name]    |        |        |

Valid Status values: Completed | BLOCKED | SKIPPED
SKIPPED is set by the engineer manually outside of any execution prompt.
BLOCKED is set by CC on verification failure in Autonomous mode.

---

## Resumed Sessions (Autonomous mode only)

| Resumed at | Resumed from Task | Blocking issue resolution |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
|            |                   |                           |

---

## Template 2 — Verification Record (VERIFICATION_RECORD.md)

**When to generate:** Per task, at the start of each task before running any commands.
**Pre-populate:** Task ID, Task Name, Scenario, Expected from EXECUTION_PLAN.md.
**Leave blank:** Result column, Prediction Statement (Manual) or omit entirely (Autonomous),
CC Challenge Output, Code Review results, Scope Decisions, BCE Impact, all verdict checkboxes.

```markdown
**Session:** [Session Name]
**Date:** 
**Engineer:** 

## [Task n.n — Task Name]

### Test Cases Applied
Source: EXECUTION_PLAN.md Session [n]

| Case | Scenario | Expected | Result |
|------|----------|----------|--------|
| TC-1 | [from execution plan] | [from execution plan] | |
| TC-2 | [from execution plan] | [from execution plan] | |

### Prediction Statement
[LEAVE BLANK — engineer writes predictions before running verification commands]

### CC Challenge Output
[Paste CC's response to: 'What did you not test in this task?'
For each item: accepted (added case) / rejected (reason).]

### Code Review
[Required only if this task touches an invariant. For TASK-SCOPED invariants,
the invariant text is already embedded in the task's CC prompt in EXECUTION_PLAN.md
— reference it here. For GLOBAL invariants, source from Claude.md Section 2.
List specific code review items: what to look for and where. Leave results blank.]

### Scope Decisions
[What was accepted as out of scope and why. Cannot be left blank for deliverables.]

### BCE Impact
[Required when this task touches a module with a MODULE_CONTRACTS.md entry.
If no BCE artifact is affected, write: No BCE artifact impact.]

| Artifact | Field | Change |
|---|---|---|

### Verification Verdict
[ ] All planned cases passed
[ ] CC challenge reviewed
[ ] Code review complete (if invariant-touching)
[ ] Scope decisions documented

**Status:**
```

## Template 3 — ENH-NNN_SCOPE.md

**When to generate:** At scoping gate before build begins. Engineer declares Sign-Off Tier here.
**Leave blank:** Engineer Sign-Off section.

```markdown
# ENH-NNN_SCOPE.md — [Enhancement Name]
**Enhancement:** ENH-NNN
**Engineer:** [name]
**Type:** A | B
**Status:** IN SCOPING | SCOPED | IN EXECUTION | COMPLETE

## 1. Enhancement Summary
[One paragraph — what this enhancement does and why]

## 2. Scope
**In scope:**
[Explicit list of what will change]

**Out of scope:**
[Explicit list of what will not change — not "TBD", must be stated]

## 3. BCE Impact Assessment
[Planning declaration only — states expected impact for scoping purposes.
Do not update discovery/ artifacts here. In a sprint context, all discovery/
updates are deferred to sprint close-out via Sprint Lead BCE refresh.]
[List affected artifacts — or state "No BCE artifact impact expected" if none]

## 4. Invariants Touched
[List each invariant from INVARIANTS.md that this enhancement touches, enforces, or adds.
For each, state its scope tag and action:]

| INV-ID | Scope | Action | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| INV-XX | GLOBAL \| TASK-SCOPED | TOUCHES \| ENFORCES \| ADDS | |

Adding a GLOBAL invariant requires a Claude.md Section 2 amendment (see Section 5).
Adding a TASK-SCOPED invariant requires embedding in EXECUTION_PLAN.md task prompts — no Claude.md amendment.
State "No invariant impact" if none — not blank.

## 5. Claude.md Impact
**Version bump required:** YES | NO
**Reason:** [if YES — what changes and why]

A version bump is required when: a new GLOBAL invariant is added, the scope boundary
changes, or a new prohibited behaviour is defined. Adding only TASK-SCOPED invariants
does not require a Claude.md version bump.

## 6. Sign-Off Tier

**Tier:** [ 1 | 2 | 3 ]

Decision criteria:
- Tier 1: Type A, single session, no invariant additions, no schema changes,
  no Claude.md version bump
- Tier 2: Type A multi-session OR invariant enforcement point changes
  (not new invariants — changes to how existing invariants are enforced or documented)
- Tier 3: Type B (new invariants, schema changes, or Claude.md version bump).
  New GLOBAL invariants require a Claude.md Section 2 amendment. New TASK-SCOPED
  invariants do not — but the enhancement is still Tier 3 and requires a full
  invariant sweep.

**Part 1 sign-off artifact:**
- Tier 1: Session Log engineer sign-off + all Verification Record verdicts PASS
- Tier 2: ENH-NNN_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md — changed invariants only
- Tier 3: ENH-NNN_VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md — full invariant sweep for touched INVs

BCE Close-Out (Part 2B) triggers on Part 1 sign-off regardless of tier.

**Tier change rule:** If the tier changes during build, update this field and
re-declare before the session continues. Do not proceed with a stale tier declaration.

## 7. Engineer Sign-Off (Scoping Gate)
I confirm the scope, BCE impact, invariant assessment, and Sign-Off Tier above are
accurate to my current understanding before build begins.

**Signature:** [engineer name]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
```

---

## Template 4 — Enhancement Brief (ENH-NNN_BRIEF.md)

**When to generate:** When an enhancement is created in the backlog. Brief matures over time.
**Review gate:** Brief review gate (Prompt 1) must pass and engineer must sign off
before brief can be included in Sprint Manifest analysis.
**Leave blank:** AI Review and Sign-Off status until gate passes.

```markdown
# ENH-NNN_BRIEF.md

**Enhancement ID:** ENH-NNN
**Title:** [Short title]
**Author:** [Engineer name]
**Date:** [Date authored]
**Status:** [ ] Draft | [ ] AI Review Complete | [ ] Signed Off

---

## Enhancement Intent
[One paragraph — plain language, what this enhancement does and why.
Not a technical specification. Legible to any engineer on the team.]

---

## Known Touch Points
[Modules, schema tables, API routes this enhancement is expected to touch.
Terminology must resolve against BCE artifact entries where possible.]

| Touch Point | BCE Artifact | Entry |
|---|---|---|
| [e.g. token ledger table] | TOPOLOGY.md | [e.g. schema/token_ledger] |

---

## Known Constraints
[Label each constraint MANDATORY or OPTIONAL.]

| Constraint | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [e.g. must not modify existing auth flow] | MANDATORY | [reason] |
| [e.g. prefer existing middleware pattern] | OPTIONAL | [can be revisited in Phase 1] |

---

## Out of Scope
[Explicit statement of what this enhancement will not touch. Not "TBD."]

---

## Engineer Sign-Off
[ ] I confirm this brief is accurate to my current understanding.
    Phase 1 may surface new information not reflected here.

**Signed:** [Engineer name]
**Date:** [Date]
```

---

## Template 5 — Sprint Manifest (SPRINT-NNN_MANIFEST.md)

**When to generate:** Sprint Lead produces this from adjudicated collision surface analysis.

---

## Dependency Graph

[Written description of all Foundation → Dependent relationships.
Independent enhancements listed separately.
Multiple Foundation tracks listed as parallel chains.
Any chain deeper than one level must be resolved before commit.]

**Chain depth validation:**
[ ] PASS — no chains deeper than one level
[ ] VIOLATION — [detail which chain and resolution required]

---

## Collision Surface Map

[One block per enhancement pair with any identified collision.
Pairs with no collision are not listed.]

### ENH-NNN × ENH-NNN

**Collision type:** BUILD-TIME | CLOSE-OUT
**Confidence:** DEFINITE | PROBABLE | NOT-DETECTABLE
**Surface:** [Named, locatable BCE artifact entry —
             e.g. MODULE_CONTRACTS.md → AuthMiddleware]
**ENH-NNN intent:** [what this enhancement intends to do with this surface]
**ENH-NNN intent:** [what this enhancement intends to do with this surface]
**Conflict nature:** [why these intents conflict or may conflict]
**Ownership:** [ENH-NNN owns this surface] |
               [Close-out reconciliation — no build-time owner]
**Sprint Lead adjudication:** [Confirmed / Downgraded to PROBABLE /
                               Downgraded to NOT-DETECTABLE / Ruled out]
**Notes:** [Sprint Lead adjudication rationale]

---

## Watchpoints

[Not-detectable surfaces assigned to specific engineers for Phase 1 confirmation.
Each watchpoint is a mandatory Phase 1 confirmation task — not optional monitoring.]

| ID | Enhancement | Surface | What Phase 1 Must Confirm | Assigned To |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| WP-001 | ENH-NNN | [BCE artifact entry] | [specific question] | [engineer] |

---

## Close-Out Reconciliation Items

[Enhancements sharing a BCE artifact section — Sprint Lead reconciles at close-out.]

| ENH IDs | BCE Artifact | Section | Nature of Overlap |
|---|---|---|---|
| ENH-NNN × ENH-NNN | [artifact] | [section] | [description] |

---

## Sprint Scope Validation

**Chain depth:** [ ] PASS | [ ] VIOLATION — [details]
**Foundation loop risk:**
[ ] Low — all Foundation enhancements are shallow and well-scoped
[ ] Flagged — [which Foundation, why, Sprint Lead risk determination]

---

## Template 7 — ENH-NNN_SPRINT_CONSTRAINTS.md

**When to generate:** Sprint Lead produces this for each building engineer after manifest adjudication.
Generated in CD using Prompt 3. Sprint Lead reviews before distributing.
**Leave blank:** Nothing — this is a complete reference document when generated.

```markdown
# ENH-NNN_SPRINT_CONSTRAINTS.md

**Enhancement ID:** ENH-NNN
**Title:** [Enhancement title]
**Sprint:** SPRINT-NNN
**Engineer:** [Name]
**Classification:** FOUNDATION | DEPENDENT | INDEPENDENT
**Produced by:** Sprint Lead from SPRINT-NNN_MANIFEST.md
**Date:** [Date]

---

## Your Classification

**Role:** [FOUNDATION | DEPENDENT | INDEPENDENT]

[One paragraph plain-language explanation of what this classification
means for this engineer in this sprint — what they can begin immediately,
what they must wait for, what they own, what they must not touch.
Must be unambiguous without opening the manifest.]

---

## Surfaces You Own

[Build-time surfaces this enhancement owns. Other enhancements will not touch these.
If no owned surfaces: state explicitly "No owned surfaces."]

| Surface | BCE Artifact Entry | Conflict Avoided |
|---|---|---|
| [e.g. AuthMiddleware] | MODULE_CONTRACTS.md → AuthMiddleware | ENH-NNN will not touch this |

---

## Surfaces You Must Not Touch

[Build-time surfaces owned by other enhancements.
Touching these without Sprint Lead escalation is a process violation.
If none: state explicitly "No restricted surfaces for this sprint."]

| Surface | BCE Artifact Entry | Owned By |
|---|---|---|
| [e.g. token_ledger schema] | TOPOLOGY.md → schema/token_ledger | ENH-NNN |

---

## Your Phase 3 Gate

[DEPENDENT enhancements only. Leave blank for FOUNDATION and INDEPENDENT
with note: "Not applicable — [FOUNDATION/INDEPENDENT] classification."]

**You may not begin Phase 3 until:**
[ ] Foundation ENH-NNN Claude.md committed and frozen — Sync Point 1 recorded
[List all Foundation enhancements this enhancement depends on.]

**Planning inputs available at Phase 3:**
- Frozen `discovery/` BCE artifacts
- Foundation ENH-NNN Claude.md
- Foundation ENH-NNN draft BCE impact log [advisory — subject to amendment per GAP4 protocol]

---

## Your Watchpoints

[Phase 1 confirmation tasks assigned from the Sprint Manifest.
Mandatory — not optional monitoring. Escalate to Sprint Lead immediately if confirmed.]

| ID | Surface | What You Must Confirm in Phase 1 | Escalate If |
|---|---|---|---|
| WP-001 | [surface] | [specific question] | [collision confirmed] |

---

## BCE Constraints

**Do not update `discovery/` artifacts during your enhancement build or close-out.**

Your per-enhancement BCE deliverable is `ENH-NNN_BCE_IMPACT.md` only — produced at
Phase 8 Part 2B close-out. Updating `discovery/` for a single enhancement mid-sprint
is a process violation. Record BCE knowledge in Verification Record BCE Impact sections
and in `ENH-NNN_BCE_IMPACT.md`. The Sprint Lead reconciles all impact logs and updates
`discovery/` once at sprint close-out.

---

## Escalation Rules

1. Any Phase 1 discovery that surfaces a new collision not in the Sprint Manifest →
   stop planning, escalate to Sprint Lead immediately before continuing
2. Any watchpoint confirmed as a collision →
   stop planning, escalate to Sprint Lead immediately
3. Any build divergence requiring amendment to your BCE impact log →
   notify Sprint Lead unconditionally — do not self-assess downstream impact

---
